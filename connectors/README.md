# Muse connector catalog

This catalog contains 150 community connector skills copied from the MIT-licensed `muse-connectors` project at commit `6e31fd44a71f9f28377a1460e64cd7483c3cce22` on September 24, 2026.

Meta says many connector actions can be limited to read-only, important actions such as sending email require approval by default, and users can disconnect integrations in Settings. A user-created custom connector is not reviewed by Meta; consult [Meta Help: Connectors](https://www.meta.com/help/artificial-intelligence/1687253048996149/) and the provider’s privacy terms before enabling one.
